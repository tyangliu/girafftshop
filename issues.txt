NOTES
- search can be extended to all models as needed (extend base Repository)

TODO

// MAIN APP:

- make queries/searches case insensitive (located in Repository and ItemRepository)
- improve searching algorithm (e.g. contains instead of exact match)
- implement query result ordering and pagination (located in Repository)

- make form validation rules more comprehensive
- complete mistakes messaging for forms (partially working)
- add form feedback and related pages (using Flash?)

- song listing for item, cart, orders, returns not yet implemented:

  - (completed) make table definition with migrations

  - add database seeding

  - make 'GirafftShop/<ModelName>s' directory for Model and associated classes

  - make models with defined 2-way relationships (hasMany, hasOne, belongsTo, belongsToMany);
    getters and setters are not needed anymore

  - make repository class for model (this contains the database CRUD and query logic);
    (this is a design pattern)

  - make controller class(es) for model

  - create command and command handlers for every operation on the model

  - create form class with validation rules as a field


// VIEWS:

- finish generic view layouts (navigation bar, footer)
- refactor views with less repetition + Presenter
- refactor sass
- complete css styling (button effects, dropdown menu styling)
- make css responsive
- animations and javascript

// ROUTES:

- reorganize routing (possibly use Route::resource or Route::controller)
- add user roles (phase 1 (easy using route filters): guest, customer, manager)
                 (phase 2 (harder(both route and menu links filtering required): clerk, administrator)
- add 404 error page + other HTTP error pages
